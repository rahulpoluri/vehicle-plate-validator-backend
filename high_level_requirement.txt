license plates, stores them in a database and provides an endpoint to retrieve all stored
plates. Secondly, we want to build a similarity search over the database .
The app should be written in Python 3, using the Fastapi web framework and SQLAlchemy as
ORM. Please, add also Unit tests to the project and pack it in a docker componse.

use redis cache for search api

this data is generated from traffic sensors which read the number plates
peak load is around 3000 vehicles per hour
vehicle record should be retained for 365 days in db
